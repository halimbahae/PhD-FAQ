🚀 **Let’s Build the Ultimate PhD Resource Hub — Together!** 🔍📚

Hey scholars, researchers, and future PhDs 👋

Tired of scattered resources, unclear training requirements, and spending hours figuring out what *actually* counts toward your doctoral journey?

🎯 **Let’s change that — as a community.**

We’re launching a **collaborative, open-source initiative** to centralize and cluster all the **mandatory and recommended PhD training units**, based on the **new national reform**.

No more chasing the “200-hour rule” — it’s now about **validating key training units** with **certificates** in the following areas:

✅ Research Methodology
✅ History of Sciences
✅ Artificial Intelligence
✅ Intellectual Property (OMPIC)
✅ IT Tools: Zotero, Mendeley
✅ Trainings inside & outside your thesis domain
✅ Entrepreneurship
✅ Pedagogical Innovation
✅ Language Training (e.g. Rosetta Stone)

💡 Some of these trainings will soon be available on Moodle (starting July), and we’ll continue enriching the platform **with your help**.

🤝 **How can you contribute?**

* Suggest topics or training modules you think should be added
* Share **well-curated resources** (preferably from Moodle or official sources)
* Tag friends from other universities — let's make this a national effort
* Please **cite sources** so we keep things clean and credible

This is a **living project**, updated over time to support *you* and future generations of researchers. Together, let’s build a **treasure trove of knowledge** 💎
